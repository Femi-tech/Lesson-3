### Fintech 4 life in lower lower font

My name is Femi Aina, in terms of background I'm british and Nigerian. I am currently a senior at berkeley college here in nyc. Although I am a "senior". I am actually graduating with my bachelors two years early. My passions are fashion, real estate, finance and tech. I am currently working in real estate as a broker but I would like to transition to the development side.
My career goals are a bit unformerd right now, I would like to work in venture capital or private equity in the future.
I chose fintech as a career path because I have a passion for both finance and tech and I feel like this program can help me decide what career path I want to take.
